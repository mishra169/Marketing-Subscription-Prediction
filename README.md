# Marketing-Subscription-Prediction

This code include:
1) EDA: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.
2) MODEL: The most important metric for this situation is recall. This is because we want the marketing team to target the clients with the highest likelihood of accepting the term deposit subscription, and recall measures the proportion of true positives (i.e., clients who would subscribe for the term deposit) among all actual positive cases (i.e., clients who were interested in subscribing). By optimizing for recall, we can ensure that the marketing team reaches out to as many interested clients as possible and maximizes the potential for subscription success.

The three models used are
i) Decision Tree
ii) Random Forest
iii) KNN-Neighbour

For data balancing we have used

i)SMOTE
ii)ADASYN

IMPORTANT OBSERVATION : INTERACT GENERATED VISUALIZATIONS WON'T WORK UNLESS YOU RUN IT YOURSELF!!!!
